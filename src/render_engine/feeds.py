    Creates an RSS feed [`Page`][render_engine.Page] Object.

    !!! Note
        This is the base object type and should only contain the params identified
        by the standards defined in the [RSS 2.0 Specification](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification)

    This is built using the built-in `rss2.0.xml` jinja template.

    !!! Note
        Some browsers may not support the `rss` extension.
        If you are having issues with your feed, try changing the extension to `xml`.

        ```python
        from render_engine import Site, RSSFeed

        class MyFeed(RSSFeed):
            extension = "xml"

        site = Site()

        @site.collection
        class MyCollection(Collection):
            Feed = MyFeed
        ```
