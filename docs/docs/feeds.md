# RSS Feed

Feed Objects for Generating RSS Feeds

## Classes

`RSSFeed`

Bases: [`BasePage`](../page?id=basepage)

Creates an RSS feed [Page](../page) Object.

> !!! Note
    This is the base object type and should only contain the params identified by the standards defined in the [RSS 2.0 Specification](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification).

This is built using the built-in `rss2.0.xml` jinja template.

> !!! Note
    Some browsers may not support the `rss` extension. If you are having issues with your feed, try changing the extension to `xml`.
    ```Python
    from render_engine import Site, RSSFeed

    class MyFeed(RSSFeed):
        extension = "xml"
    site = Site()

    @site.collection
    class MyCollection(Collection):
        Feed = MyFeed
    ```
