# Archive

Archives are a [`BasePage`](../page?id=basepage) object used to display a list of [`Page`](../page?id=page) objects in a [`Collection`](../collection?id=collection).

Archive objects create a customizable page that can be controlled via its parent Collection.

Bases: [`BasePage`](../page?id=basepage)

The Archive is a [Page](../page?id=page) object used by the collection
that focuses on presenting the Collection's pages.

> !!! Warning Not Directly Used

    The Archive object is not meant to be used directly.
    It is used by the [Collection](../collection?id=collection) object.
    Attributes can be used to customize.

Collection.archives yields a generator of Archive objects. Each Archive object will have a `pages` attribute that is a list of Page objects referenced in that Archive Page. The number of pages is determined by the `Collection.items_per_page` attribute.

## Enabling Archive Pages

By default render engine will only create the archive page if either of the following conditions are met:

- The `Collection.items_per_page` attribute is set to a value greater than 0.
- The `Collection.has_archive` attribute is set to True.

## Archive Page Numbers

Archive pages are numbered starting at `0`. **The first page is always a list containing all the items.**

If `items_per_page` is greater than `0`, the remaining will contain the items in the collection, split into groups of `items_per_page`.

You can get the total number of `Archive` pages by grabbing the `Archive.num_archive_pages` attribute.
