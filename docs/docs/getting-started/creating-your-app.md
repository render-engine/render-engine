## Create your site file

You can get started quickly using the `render-engine init` cli command.

The `init` command is a hook to call [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) so, you need to install it first.

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

Then run the init command and provide the required parameters for initializing a template.

```bash
render-engine init
```

or

```bash
python -m render_engine init
```

## Available Options

`init` has a few options that you can use to customize your site

You can view the options using the `--help` flag.
