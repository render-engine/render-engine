This document will walk you through the basics of Render Engine.

## Installing Render Engine

In order to use render engine, you must have python 3.9+ installed. You can download python from [python.org](https://python.org).

- Linux/MacOS: [python.org](https://python.org)
- Windows: [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K)

Render Engine is available in PyPI and can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install render-engine
```

Render Engine also supports multiple parsers and modules. You will need to install them separately.

For example, to use the rss parser, you will need to install the [render-engine-rss] module:

pip install render-engine render-engine-rss
```
